<h1 style="text-align: center;"> 39th British Colloquium for <br />Theoretical Computer Science</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">3rd-4th April 2023, University of Glasgow </h2>

The [British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science (BCTCS)](https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.

BCTCS 2023 will include special sessions on implementing theory, and computer science pedagogy.
