title: 39th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science
---
## 3rd-5th April 2023, University of Glasgow

The [British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science (BCTCS)](https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.

BCTCS 2023 will include special sessions on implementing theory, and computer science pedagogy.

## Venue and Travel

The event will be held in the Advanced Research Centre at the University of Glasgow's main Gilmorehill campus, in the West End of Glasgow. The venue is a short walk from Hillhead subway station. The subway, in turn, is easily accessible from Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street railway stations, and Buchanan Street bus station. If arriving by plane, there are regular buses to Buchanan Street bus station from both Glasgow International Airport and Edinburgh International Airport. For further details, see [The University's travel pages](https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/maps/).

## Call for Talks

If you would like to contribute a 25 minute talk, please email a title and brief abstract to [the organisers](mailto:bctcs23@lists.cent.gla.ac.uk) by 3rd March 2023. Contributions from PhD students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged. The scope of "theoretical computer science" is intended to be interpreted broadly, so please ensure that your talk is accessible to other students who may not be specialists in your research topic.

## Registration

Further details to be announced.
