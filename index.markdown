# 39th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science
## 3rd-4th April 2023, University of Glasgow

The [British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science (BCTCS)](https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.

BCTCS 2023 will include special sessions on implementing theory, and computer science pedagogy.

## Registration

[Registration is now open](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bctcs-2023-tickets-557075286177) until 23rd March.

## Call for Talks

If you would like to contribute a talk, please email a title, a brief abstract, and a very short bio to [the organisers](mailto:bctcs23@lists.cent.gla.ac.uk). The 3rd March deadline has passed, but we can fit in a few more talks on a first come first served basis. Please specify whether you would prefer to give a 25 + 5 minute talk, or a 5 + 5 minute talk. Contributions from PhD students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged. There are no restrictions on the originality or publication status of submissions. There will be no formal proceedings either, but the abstracts will be available on the event website. The scope of "theoretical computer science" is intended to be interpreted broadly, so please ensure that your talk is accessible to other students who may not be specialists in your research topic.
